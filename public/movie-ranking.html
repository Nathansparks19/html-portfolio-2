 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>
  Avengers: Endgame (2019) is an epic conclusion to the Infinity Saga in the
  Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film
  picks up after Infinity War, where Thanos has wiped out half of all life. The
  remaining Avengers, devastated and desperate, embark on a time-travel mission
  to retrieve the Infinity Stones and reverse the catastrophe.
</p>
<p>
  The movie delivers emotional depth, stunning action sequences, and satisfying
  character arcs. Tony Stark’s sacrifice, Steve Rogers’ farewell, and the
  climactic final battle make it a thrilling and heartfelt experience. While it
  relies on fan service and nostalgia, Endgame successfully wraps up a decade of
  storytelling, making it one of the most memorable superhero films of all time.
</p>
<h3>Mulan</h3>
<p>
  Mulan is a 1998 animated Disney film based on the Chinese legend of Hua Mulan.
  The story follows a young woman, Mulan, who disguises herself as a man to take
  her ailing father’s place in the army, defying societal norms. With the help
  of her witty dragon companion, Mushu, she trains as a soldier and ultimately
  plays a crucial role in saving China from the invading Huns.
</p>
<p>
  The film is praised for its strong female protagonist, stunning animation, and
  memorable songs like Reflection and I'll Make a Man Out of You. It balances
  action, humor, and heartfelt moments, making it an inspiring tale of bravery,
  identity, and self-discovery.
</p>
<p>
  The song "I'll Make a Man Out of You" really touched me, and specific lyrics
  in the song resonated with me, such as... <br />
  You must be swift as the coursing river <br />
  (Be a man) with all the force of a great typhoon <br />
  (Be a man) with all the strength of a raging fire <br />
  Mysterious as the dark side of the moon <br />
</p>
<h3>Moon Knight</h3>
<p>
  Moon Knight is a Marvel superhero series that stands out for its psychological
  depth and unique storytelling. The show follows Marc Spector, a former
  mercenary with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), who becomes the avatar of
  the Egyptian moon god, Khonshu. As he struggles with multiple identities,
  including the timid Steven Grant, he is drawn into a dark, supernatural
  conflict.
</p>
<p>
  The series is praised for Oscar Isaac’s stellar performance, bringing
  complexity to Marc and Steven’s duality. Its blend of action, mythology, and
  psychological thriller elements makes it different from traditional Marvel
  shows. The darker tone, mind-bending sequences, and well-executed character
  development make Moon Knight a gripping watch, though some found the pacing
  inconsistent.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, it’s a fresh and intriguing addition to the MCU, especially for fans
  of psychological dramas with a supernatural twist.
